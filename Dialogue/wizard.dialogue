Wizard: I have the power of teleportation.
Wizard: Wanna try it out?
- Sure, why not.
	Wizard: Aight. Here goes.
	do Utils.transfer("world2", Vector2(17,15))
	do Utils.look_at_pawn("Player", "Wizard")
- Eh, I don't feel like it.
	Wizard: It's OK. Come back when you do.
	do Utils.turn(Vector2.DOWN, "Wizard")
